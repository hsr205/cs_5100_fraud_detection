## Introduction


The financial fraud detection system imposes supervised and unsupervised learning methods on a financial dataset to determine which transactions can / cannot be classified as fraud. The system has been trained on a large data set of more than six million data points and can determine which transactions are/are not fraudulent as evidenced by our discoveries Using K-Means Clustering, we could separate data points indicating fraud from those data points representing valid transactions. By leveraging a feed-forward neural network, with nearly six million data points as input we were able to determine fraudulent transactions in [ENTER PERCENTAGE] of the time.
