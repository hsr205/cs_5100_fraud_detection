## Introduction


The financial fraud detection system contains both supervised and unsupervised learning methods on a financial dataset to determine which transactions can and cannot be classified as fraud. The system has been trained on a large data set of more than six million data points and can accurately predict fraud in up to 90% of different cases. By leveraging various approaches such as K-Means, random forest, anomaly detection, and a feed-forward neural network we as a team were able to gain valuable insights into how financial fraud can and cannot be properly classified.
